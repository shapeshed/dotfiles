# pre_import: The pre_import hook is invoked after all issues have been pulled

# exit early.

# This section is for configuring notifications when bugwarrior-pull runs,
# and when issues are created, updated, or deleted by bugwarrior-pull.
# Three backends are currently supported:
#
#  - growlnotify (v2)   Mac OS X   "gntp" must be installed
#  - gobject            Linux      python gobject must be installed
#
# To configure, adjust the settings below.  Note that neither of the #
# "sticky" options have any effect on Linux.  They only work for
# growlnotify.
